slurm-llnl (14.03.8-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  Since version 14.03.7 many binary packages have been
  renamed to remove the llnl acronym because the slurm
  project in not hosted anymore at the Lawrence Livermore
  National Laboratory. A list of the name changes follows:

  slurm-llnl -> slurm-wlm (slurm-client, slurmd, slurmctld)
  slurm-llnl-slurdbd -> slurmdbd
  slurm-llnl-basic-plugins -> slurm-wlm-basic-plugins
  slurm-llnl-basic-plugins-dev -> slurm-wlm-basic-plugins-dev
  slurm-llnl-sview -> sview
  slurm-llnl-doc -> slurm-wlm-doc

  The old slurm-llnl package content have been split in
  three different packages: slurctld with the central
  management daemon, slurmd with the compute node daemon and
  slurm-client with client side commands. The old slurm-llnl
  package content system can still be obtained by installing
  the new slurm-wlm metapackage.

  The new slurm-wlm package supports systemd.
