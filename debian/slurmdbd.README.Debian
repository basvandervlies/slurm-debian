Upgrading slurmdbd from version 1
=================================
The 2.0 slurmdbd will work with SLURM daemons at version 1.3.7 and
above. You will not need to update all clusters at the same time, but it
is very important to update slurmdbd first and having it running before
updating any other clusters making use of it. No real harm will come
from updating your systems before the slurmdbd, but they will not talk
to each other until you do.
